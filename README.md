# projetoAgenda

This project was the first contact I had with a CRUD application (create, read, update and delete).
In this application, the user can register/login, save informations about his friends, edit them and delete.

To build this project, I used:

- JavaScript;
- BootStrap;
- MongoDB;
- EJS.
